Getting the exampe data
***********************

You can download the data for the tutorials as a zipped archive by clicking
`here <https://github.com/joaks1/pymsbayes-tutorial-data/zipball/master>`_.
Once you download and unzip the archive, you will have a directory ("folder")
named something like ``joaks1-pymsbayes-tutorial-data-3da1322``.
Rename this directory to ``pymsbayes-tutorial-data`` to make it
easier to follow along with the tutorials.

Alternatively, if you prefer, you can also get the data via |git|_::

    $ git clone https://github.com/joaks1/pymsbayes-tutorial-data.git
