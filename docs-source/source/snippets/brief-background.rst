Biogeographers are often interested in understanding how environmental changes
affect the evolution of whole communities of species.
Processes that operate on the scale of communities often predict population
divergences and/or demographic changes that are temporally clustered across
taxa.
|Eco| provides a tool for testing such predictions using Bayesian model choice
:cite:`Oaks2018ecoevolity`.
