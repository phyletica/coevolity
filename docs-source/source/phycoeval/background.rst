Many processes of diversification can affect multiple multiple species.
For example, let's imagine three species of lizards co-occurring
on an island that is fragmented twice by rising sea levels:

    Island fragmentation causing shared divergences.


Now, let's imagine the initial rise in sea level fragmenting the island into
more than two islands. This could cause (shared) multifurcating divergences:

    Island fragmentation causing multifurcating, shared divergences.

These are biogeographic examples.
There are other processes across biology that also predict shared
shared divergences.
